# Sample Filesystems (nVidia Tegra TX2)

These are some example TX sample file systems that can be used as an alternative to the tegra sample filesystem provided by nVidia.

These have been tested against the latest L4T R28.1 (July 2017).

* Debootstrap created Xenial filesystem with minimal Xfce4 Desktop Environment
* Debootstrap created Xenial filesystem with minimal commandline only

All file systems come with one administrator user account
